A cute little helper that can sing and dance for you :D

This is a Discord bot that I made to entertain residents of my personal server. 
It can only play music from youtube URLs for now, due to node-ytdl-core being the only node I found compatible; I will try to write a python equivalent in the future so it can search keywords instead of URL too.

Future plans:
1. Make it able to play local songs
2. Make it able to search keywords
3. Make it able to play soundcloud links
